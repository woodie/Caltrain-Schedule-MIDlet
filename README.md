# Next Caltrain

This project is a Caltrain Schedule for the new Nokia 3310 3G.

The Nokia 3310 3G has no geo location capabilities, but the phone knows what time it is, so this app shows the next train at your morning and evening stations. These idefault stations can be selected and saved from the menu icon.

Keypad actions:
• [1] Shift departure station South
• [3] Shift departure station North
• [4] Swop departure and arrival stations
• [6] Swop weekend and weekday schedules
• [7] Shift arrical station Sount
• [9] Shift arrical station North
